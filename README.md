Project Description

I'm an analyst at Megaline, a federal cellular operator. Clients are offered two tariff plans: Smart and Ultra. In order to adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which plan brings in the most money.

I will do a preliminary analysis of the tariffs on a small sample of customers. I have the data of 500 "Megaline" users at my disposal: who they are, where they come from, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent in 2018. I need to analyze customer behavior and draw a conclusion - which tariff is better.

I need to analyze the data:

Describe the behavior of the operator's customers based on the sample. How many minutes of talk time, how many messages and how much Internet traffic do users need for each tariff per month? Calculate the average number, variance and standard deviation. Construct histograms. Describe the distributions.

Test the hypotheses:

The average revenue of Ultra and Smart tariff users is different;

The average revenue of users from Moscow differs from users from other regions.
